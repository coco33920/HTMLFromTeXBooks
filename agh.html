  Welcome to the PDF book of A Galactic HRT, this book was written using the ScribbleHub version of the story, on \LaTeX's book
  environment.<br/>
  </p>
<p>
Not so much artistic choices have been made, the chapter numbering is different from the ScribbleHub numbering
because here the multi-parts chapters are joined into only one chapter.

Our spaceship just dropped out of <a href="ftl">FTL</a> in the outer fairing of a stellar system,
the star is a class G yellow star, with a mass of approximately 0.8 Union Standard Stellar Mass (USSM),
radioactivity is normal, and particle emission seems to indicate that the star is approximately midlife.<br/>
</p>
<p>
We are currently in orbit of the 8th planet,
a beautiful but useless blue gas giant,
our engineer is looking the drive to see when we can resume our mission,
we are more than 80 light years away from home, and we still have a few anomalies to investigate.
While we're blocked into this stellar system the sensors are at full power to see if any biological activity is present.<br/>
