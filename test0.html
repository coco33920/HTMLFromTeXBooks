- “This mission is becoming very boring”, Aarin said to himself,
Aarin was on his second year of the human observation mission, in the far Sol system, 
he was a xenobiologist, xenosociologist and more importantly a xenolinguist, 
Aarin was the first of \gls{union} Science Program to fully understand the Earth Standard language and 
learn it enough to be fluent, so naturally he was chosen to be on the second maned observation mission after the 
famous discovery made a few union years ago, no more than a century ago he corrected himself, he must think in humans units.<br/>

<p>

Unfortunately the mission was really boring, the automated probes stationed in the system were 
excellent at their job, so he didn't have a lot to do. The next refueling ship was excepted next 
month, but he really was lonely. On a whim he decided to check on his latest… discovery.<br/>

</p>

<p>

See, his society does not have the concept of… gender it was a completely alien concept to them, so as a 
xenosociologist he was thrilled to study this specie, he knew humans were not ready for first contact yet, 
they only were an archaic society, a class 1 on the Union Scale, they only managed to exploit the resources of their 
planet, and they really were doing a bad job at it, probes and scopes calculated that the atmospheric composition was 
becoming toxic to the Earthen lives.<br/>

</p>

<p>

However, they outran every calculation of the union scientists when they unionized their planet in only two decades. 
And they were really coming from far away… In and all their society was fascinating to study. 
He secretly hoped they'll correct their trajectory and one day become ready to integrate the local inter-stellar community, 
the rhythm of their discovery and the speed at which they develop new technologies were incredible.<br/>
