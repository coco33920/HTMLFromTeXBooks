I jolted awake at the sound of my alarm going off, 
today was Sunday, but I have a meeting with Sylvia to draw, 
they said they had a new idea for a powerful new propulsion system to incorporate into our vessel, however 
I had to review it to see if the idea seems plausible and how to draw it.<br/>

<p>

My house automation system sensed the fact I was awake and 
started the morning routine, I watched by the window as the curtains opened and 
saw the beautiful Sunday sun creeping by it, the sky was blue and unblemished, only disturbed by the 
slight shadow of a delivery drone passing by or the few air cabs circulating in center \gls{np}.<br/>

- “Good morning Ariana” said my house AI voice<br/>

“It's 1200h, 12th of October 2040, we have an outside temperature of 19 °C in New Paris, 
the university sent you 3 email during the night nothing too important just a remainder your 
assignment is due tomorrow before 2pm, your meeting with Sylvia is scheduled for 1pm” the AI dutifully said<br/>

The temperature is a bit chilly but nothing surprising given the location of New Paris,
a big city in the intersection of the once mighty European powers (France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy) 
now unified in the European State “\gls{europe}”, following the events of the \gls{mic} in 2023, 
each continent started to unify themselves for the next decade, in 2028 with the \gls{ut} the once European Union 
and the other nations of the European continent unified and formed a new nation called “Europe”. 
Following the European example all other continents managed to mostly unionized.<br/>
